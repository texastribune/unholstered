# Unholstered

*The Texas Tribune's Unholstered project on police shootings in Texas. Built by (https://github.com/rdmurphy)[Ryan Murphy] and (https://github.com/joliesky)[Jolie McCullough].*

This project was built using the Tribune's data visuals kit. We used the javascript libraries D3 and Swiper to enhance the landing page of our project.

## Quickstart

Run this command in your project's folder:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/texastribune/idv-kit/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1
```

Next, `npm install`.

Now, get to work!
