# Unholstered

The Texas Tribune's Unholstered project on police shootings in Texas.

This project was produced by [Ryan Murphy](https://github.com/rdmurphy) and [Jolie McCullough](https://github.com/joliesky) using the Texas Tribune's Data Visuals kit. [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper) were used to create the visuals and landing page experience.

## Quickstart

_Please note - some static assets required to make this project work are only accessible to Texas Tribune developers._

Clone the project, then run `npm install`. Then pull down the assets with `npm run assets:pull`, and the data with `npm run data:fetch`. Use `npm run serve` to run the local development server.

Now, get to work!
