# Data Visuals Kit

*A work in progress. Do not use yet.*

I don't know if this will be the final resting place for this, but it needs somewhere to live.

## Quickstart

Run this command in your project's folder:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/texastribune/idv-kit/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1
```

Next, `npm install`.

Now, get to work!
