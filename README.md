# Unholstered

*The Texas Tribune's Unholstered project on police shootings in Texas. Built by [Ryan Murphy](https://github.com/rdmurphy) and [Jolie McCullough](https://github.com/joliesky).*

This project was built using the Tribune's data visuals kit. We used the javascript libraries [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [Swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/get-started/#.V_WCopMrKRs) to enhance the landing page of our project.

## Quickstart

Run this command in your project's folder:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/texastribune/idv-kit/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1
```

Next, `npm install`.

Now, get to work!
