/**
 * Where custom filters for Nunjucks should be added. Each key should be the
 * name of the filter, and each value should be a function it will call.

 * (journalize comes built in and does not need to be added manually.)
 *
 * Example:
 * module.exports = {
 *   square: (val) => val * val
 * }
 *
 * Then in your templates:
 * {{ num|square }}
